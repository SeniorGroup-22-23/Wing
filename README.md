## Common Errors    
There is some problem with certificates when using xcode git controls to push/pull. When off of eduroam it works fine (I THINK eduroam has some kind of proxy/and or cache set up that blocks the certificates). Also will not work on public internet connections. 

If you cant preview the UI content - check to make sure the project is not on your icloud (or download it) ad restart xcode. Should fix the issue.
